# Three.js Capsule Movement Project

This project showcases a simple 3D scene built with **Three.js** where a capsule geometry moves around a ground plane using WASD controls. It includes basic lighting, direction indicators, and boundary constraints for the capsule's movement.

## Features
- **3D Scene**: Built using **Three.js** with a capsule geometry and a ground plane.
- **WASD Movement Controls**: 
  - `W` - Move forward
  - `A` - Move left
  - `S` - Move backward
  - `D` - Move right
- **Directional Indicator**: A red arrow shows the current direction of movement.
- **Boundaries**: The capsule is constrained within the ground plane.
- **Lighting**: Ambient light illuminates the scene.

## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A package manager like **npm** or **yarn**.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. **navigate to project repository**
    cd threejs-capsule-movement
3. Install Dependencies:
    npm install
4. Start the Development Server: If using Vite or another development tool:
    npm run dev
5. Open in Browser: Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:
    http://http://localhost:5173

### Code Structure

src/main.js (or equivalent entry file)
This file is the main entry point of the application where the Three.js scene is initialized and rendered.

createThreeJSCube(container)
Scene Setup: Initializes a THREE.Scene and adds a camera, renderer, and lighting.

Geometry: Creates a capsule geometry with CapsuleGeometry and a ground plane with PlaneGeometry.

Movement Controls: WASD keys control the movement of the capsule, while boundaries are enforced within the ground plane.

ArrowHelper: A direction arrow is attached to the capsule to indicate the movement direction.

Animation Loop: The scene continuously renders using requestAnimationFrame.

public/index.html

Contains the HTML boilerplate where the canvas for the Three.js scene is rendered.

Other Notes
The capsuleâ€™s movement logic is handled within event listeners for the keydown and keyup events.
The camera is fixed in place to provide a clear view of the scene, and the capsule is kept at a constant height above the ground.
